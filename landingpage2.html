         helping with weight loss, reducing obesity,
         curing intestinal disorders, relieving constipation, 
         and conditions like dysentery, anemia, arthritis, gout, kidney,
         and urinary disorders. Banana can also help with menstrual
         problems and burns.
          Bananas provide antioxidants like flavonoids and amines.
         They're great for exercise recovery:
          Bananas contain magnesium and potassium, 
         two electrolytes often needing 
         replenishment among athletes after sweating through challenging workouts.
